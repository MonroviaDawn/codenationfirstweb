        <p class="p2">There’s a stark contrast between this session and the last time Kanye debuted his album for a stadium full of people (The Life of Pablo at Madison Square Garden in 2016). This time, Kanye isn’t surrounded by a group of collaborators. He’s all alone in the middle of the stadium under a single spotlight. From the stands, all we see is a small silhouette in the middle of a massive stadium. The contrast is striking.</p> 
        <p class="p2">
        Kanye stands motionless with his arms by his side and his head tilted forward. Visually, the show evokes a feeling of loneliness as he stands solo on the field, gazed upon by tens of thousands of fans. This was undoubtedly intentional.</p>
        <p class="p2">For the next 30 minutes or so, Kanye’s movements mirror the ebbs and flow of the album. He stands motionless for long stretches at a time, staring at the floor. Still, it’s clear he’s here to engage with his fans. Throughout the whole session, he never utters a word—in keeping with the silent nature of his entire year—and he keeps his mask on. Instead of speaking, he engages with his whole body, running in exaggerated movements across the field and occasionally lifting his arms to encourage everyone else to do the same. He’s here to feel the love after two years of distance. We all are.</p>
        <p class="p2">When the final note of the album finishes playing, Kanye takes a very long look at the crowd, lingering a few extra beats, as if he doesn’t want to leave. Eventually, he walks off the field in silence and the lights turn on..</p>
